# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deployed Link

[https://cmoneil.github.io/k-messenger-app/](https://cmoneil.github.io/k-messenger-app/)

## To run the project locally

In the project directory, first run:

### `yarn install` or `npm install`

Once finished installing the packages run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Design and Language decisions

I decided to write a React/JS app as it's my favorite language and library to work with and it's what I'm most comfortable with. Using React probably allows me to provide the best  representation of my coding ability and style. I also chose to use material-ui as I have quite a bit of experience with it and it provides some easy built-in styles and functionality.

### Process for verifying the correctness of program
Made sure it loaded the different Json files
Checked that it generates a message when selecting the data from each Json file.
Entered in a custom template to make sure that a custom template would populate as well.

### What I didn't get to or what I would do with more time
I would definitely refine the styling a little bit and maybe modify some of the button functionality. I would also abstract some of the handlers so its not as repetitive. Lastly I would clean up the create message function as it definitely feels a little busy and feels like it's doing too much. I don't love using string replace to modify the template message, it turned out ok, but is not the most elegant solution.
